# My Blog (Archived)

I built this in year 2020 during the pandemic 1st wave lockdown when things
were indeed uncertain and I had indefinite time to work on it. I built this
blog with the theme of CTF player because I started to engage into playing
CTFs.

I'm moving out from this to a new design, not because this was bad. I'm on
full circle again with 2nd wave of lockdown. 

New wave new blog :)
